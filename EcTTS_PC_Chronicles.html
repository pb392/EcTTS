<div class="About">
    <p id="info"><h1>
    <strong>PC Chronicles</strong> is our first true attempt at making a card game feel as if players are playing an
    RPG. With 24 unique Player Stat cards and 6 Race cards for the player to choose from, as well as the choice of 3
    Class Rule Cards out of a total of 18 different options, every player will be able to completely change the way
    card games are played. With over 2,000 different ways to build your Player Character and Ruleset, this game truly
    will feel like you're playing an RPG.
</h1></p>
    <p id="play"><h2>
    Players will start out with 100 Life and will have the option of a unique Stat Card denoting the player's
    Strength, Dexterity, Arcana, and Charisma; a Race Card that will slightly alter the base stats slightly and give
    players a unique ability, Max Hand Size, Starting Hand Size, and amount of cards drawn per turn; and an assortment
    of 3 Class Rule Cards out of the possible 6 Main Classes altering the Max Party Size and denoting the amount of
    Action Cards and Summon Cards that can be played during every turn. On top of that, each different Main Class has
    3 different subclasses to choose from. This makes PC Chronicles the card game with the most amount of unique deck
    combinations, ruleset, and player starting formations.
    <br><br>
    Players are also only allowed to build their 40 card deck with cards of their corresponding Main Classes. Each card
    is capped at 2 of a kind, and every card has up to 2 different versions allowing for every 2 of a kind to really be
    4 of kind. This rule is not applied to the subclass card. That card is only a 1 of a kind for the subclass, but can
    scale to 3 of a kind depending on how the player chooses their subclasses. The types of card per deck is not the
    only thing the subclasses alter about the game. Every subclass has specific rules that specify the player's ability
    to play Action cards or summon other Party Members, as well as changing the base Party Size for their play area.
    This means no two decks will ever be or play the same.

    <strong>RPChess</strong> is a new take on the classic game of Chess we all know and love. Imagine games of Chess
    with different setups every time, every piece interacts differently, and the flow of the game can change on a dime.
    All of this and more is possible with RPChess. Using the classic 8x8 Chess Board and the original Chess Pieces;
    adding Tactical RPG elements like HP, ATK, upgrades and more; and giving a set order in which every piece moves;
    every game will feel like you're playing a Tactical RPG in real life. Players will have a King and an option of 5
    different pieces to amass a fighting force to play against another player's army. And the best part is, all players
    need is a chess board for playing pieces.
</h1></p>
    <p id="play"><h2>
    Players will have the option of choosing their unique Army with a total of 6 Chess Pieces. Players will have the
    ability to upgrade every piece with different upgrade cards based on their allotted Upgrade Slots. These upgrades
    may even have the ability to alter the Base Speed of the piece unintentionally changing when the piece can move
    during the game. On top of everything else, player also have the option of 3 different Command Cards that can help
    turn the tide of war. These options are based on the different pieces the player chose to include in their army and
    even have a specific wait time from when they can be played. These Command Cards also have a unique ability to
    change which player goes first that round. If both player's Command Cards are played at the same time, the round
    starts as usual.
    <br><br>
    As the game releases new expansions, there will be a new way to expand the creativity in creating an army. Class
    Cards will be able to change the Base Pieces into a new incarnation of themselves, so players will have the
    opportunity to create an army that suites them even more.

    <p id="info"><h1>
    <strong>Codex Breakerz</strong> is a Collectable Card Game with the sole purpose of being a card game thatâ€™s easy to
    learn and get into, while possessing a high skill ceiling the longer the game is out. With a unique card design,
    players will get to play and build decks with some of the most interesting ratios card games have ever seen.
    Players will also be able to play in a multitude of different formats using the same cards in various unique ways.

</h1></p>
    <p id="play"><h2>
    The game is built to be both fast and intricate. With only 35 cards in a deck, and 30 starting life, the game throws
    everything at the players from the start. Every card in the game, except the "Familiar Link Cards", are 2 cards
    in one, meaning when the player wants to play a card, they must decide between using the top effect or the
    bottom effect. Players also get to have special abilities depending on what Familiar Link card they choose
    to use. The playing field also has a unique design with having only 3 summonable zones and 5 zones to place cards
    face down, every choice counts. This is the first game to have mechanics like this, and is a very interesting
    game to play.
    <br><br>
    <strong><em>Alongside the main format, there are also many other formats to play and get creative.</em></strong>
    With Brawl Mode, there is a completely different feel to the game, changing the entire way of building a deck to
    how every card is played. With 50 cards per deck, 2 copies per card, 40 starting life and a complete overhaul to
    the original rules, Brawl Mode takes Codex Breakerz to a new level. With Highlander Frontier, the playing field is
    swapped, with 5 summonable zones and 3 face down zones, a limitation of only having 1 copy of any card per deck,
    and doubling the other aspects of the original format, 60 Life, 70 Card Deck Size, and a Deck Cost of 150. This
    format also adapts the original format's Familiar Rule as players can have 3 Familiars and 3 Familiar Links.
    The 3 Familiars must be placed in the deck, as well as have a copy denoting what 3 are the Familiars. As we release
    more sets, the potential for more formats will arise, Look out for this and more.
